# Agent Capability Compatibility

The desktop derives feature availability from Agent evidence so newer UI can coexist with older system-installed Hermes Agent versions.

## Capability snapshot

The renderer receives one normalized, non-secret snapshot instead of interpreting versions or backend payloads independently.

[[src/shared/agent-capabilities.ts#buildAgentCapabilitySnapshot]] combines the Agent's desktop contract, API capability probe, version metadata, update hint, and connection mode. Each feature is supported, unsupported, or unknown; absence never becomes an unsupported claim.

The desktop contract is monotonic. Contract 1 proves dashboard chat, 2 adds `file.attach`, 3 adds approval-mode management, 4 adds explicit normal-tier sessions, 5 raises attachment frame capacity, and 6 adds key-addressed plugin management.

Command-specific features use the Agent's existing `commands.catalog` response instead of version guesses. Background prompts, queues, tool-call steering, session loops, voice commands, and automation blueprints are supported only when their canonical command is present.

## Bounded runtime evidence

Only compatibility metadata from `session.info` crosses back into the main-process evidence cache.

[[src/main/hermes.ts#recordAgentRuntimeInfo]] retains `desktop_contract`, `version`, `release_date`, `update_behind`, and `update_command`. Model state, tools, prompts, paths, and other session data are discarded by [[src/shared/agent-capabilities.ts#sanitizeAgentRuntimeInfo]].

[[src/main/hermes.ts#getAgentCapabilityEvidence]] combines the cached runtime evidence with the existing `/v1/capabilities` probe. Evidence is keyed by the run's stable connection ID plus profile, and missing reconnect evidence clears stale runtime and command claims.

API probe caching includes a one-way credential scope, so two records that share an endpoint but use different credentials cannot reuse each other's capability result. Inactive status snapshots reuse only bounded evidence already observed for their own identity.

## Bounded command inventory

Only normalized command names are retained from the Agent command catalog so feature gates do not persist descriptions, aliases, skill metadata, or user quick-command bodies.

[[src/main/hermes.ts#recordAgentCommandInventory]] passes the runtime catalog through [[src/shared/agent-capabilities.ts#sanitizeAgentCommandInventory]], which accepts canonical command pairs, rejects malformed names, deduplicates them, and caps the cache at 512 names.

The catalog is a conservative probe: a returned catalog can prove a command supported or unsupported, while an unavailable catalog clears prior inventory and leaves every command-derived feature unknown. A changed Agent version or desktop contract also invalidates prior command evidence.

## Compatibility policy

Older Agents keep the existing experience while newer surfaces gate themselves on explicit evidence.

A missing desktop contract is `legacy`, not a hard failure. A contract below the recommended value suggests an Agent update, while direct Remote connections disable the local update action because that process is not owned by this desktop.

[[src/main/ipc/register.ts#registerIpcHandlers]] exposes the snapshot plus bounded runtime-info and command-inventory recorders through preload. [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/AboutPane.tsx#AboutPane]] shows the observed and recommended desktop contracts alongside the independent Agent update action.

## Test specifications

Focused tests protect normalization, legacy fallback, bounded evidence, and representative old/current Agent contracts.

### Current contract normalization

The current desktop contract and advertised API transport produce supported feature states with normalized version and update metadata.

### Legacy capability fallback

Missing capability evidence remains unknown while legacy version output is still presented and direct Remote updating stays disabled.

### Runtime evidence boundary

Runtime evidence keeps compatibility fields and drops prompts, tools, models, paths, and other session data.

### Command inventory gates

A valid command catalog enables only named Agent features, rejects malformed command names, and leaves every command-derived gate unknown when discovery is unavailable.

### Older Agent contract

A pre-desktop-contract Agent keeps every unproven feature unknown while preserving its version metadata and disabling host-local updates for a direct Remote connection.

### Current Agent contract

The current Agent's runtime info, API capability response, and command catalog combine into a compatible snapshot whose advertised features are supported.

### Evidence invalidation

Cached command evidence is discarded after catalog discovery fails or a replacement Agent reports a different version or desktop contract, preventing stale feature gates after reconnect.
