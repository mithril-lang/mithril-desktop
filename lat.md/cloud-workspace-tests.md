# Cloud workspace tests

The main-process adapter enforces account-bound consent and a narrow portable-data boundary even when the renderer or network supplies invalid input.

## Dedicated authorization scopes

Cloud Workspace requires explicit workspace read and write scopes; inference and billing credentials are not upgraded or sent to a credential-issuance route.

## Explicit consent

Before opt-in, account identity may be checked but user workspace data cannot be fetched or written.

## Narrow data and fixed transport

Unknown configuration, path, permission and secret fields fail before networking; only explicitly authored operations reach the fixed API with redirects and cookies disabled.

## Account isolation

Replacing the secure-store token, switching local profiles or signing out clears prior consent and requires a new explicit opt-in.

## Late responses and expiry

Responses arriving after logout cannot repopulate user data; expired or refused identity resets the workspace before further requests.

## Offline and owner mismatch

Transient network errors preserve consent for retry without exposing exception secrets, while a snapshot for a different owner resets the session.

## Conflict and history

CAS conflict responses retain their operation ids for shared UI resolution; record history remains bounded to the requested record and rejects injected secret fields.

## Trusted renderer

Only the main Desktop window's trusted top frame may invoke workspace IPC; webviews, secondary windows, remote navigation and other development origins are refused.

## Shared renderer consent

Desktop mounts shared screens and automatically reads through existing scoped main authorization. Observation does not write or grant scopes.

## Renderer account reset

Account-change events and local profile changes clear the prior renderer owner and recheck scoped identity before reading the new workspace. They never replay edits or tools.

## Bot and project import

An explicit preview projects the actual selected bot instructions, user context, model preference, linked project titles and capability preferences. Known device-specific text is excluded and preview makes no cloud write or native mutation.

## Cloud sidebar identity

Sidebar reads and writes use only fixed cloud routes, preserve operation IDs, reject nonportable input, and discard records from a different owner.

## Paged native history migration

Completed local chat histories can be reviewed in bounded pages beyond the first fifty; opening a page never uploads history or runs inference.

## Cloud schedule boundaries

Schedule tests cover fixed API routes, owner validation, scope refusal and local-only preview projection.

Credentials, absolute paths, scripts, delivery destinations and native tool grants are excluded. Calendar schedules require an explicit new interval; no background import starts a cloud run.

## Stable disconnected identity

Repeated denied sign-in or missing-scope checks preserve the disconnected error instead of emitting account-change events that remount the renderer indefinitely. Explicit resets still invalidate in-flight requests.
