# Desktop Updates

Desktop updates use GitHub releases and expose both a startup upgrade action and a Settings auto-upgrade preference.

The Electron main process configures `electron-updater` against the repository publisher metadata from `electron-builder.yml`, which points at `fathah/hermes-desktop`. [[src/main/app/updater.ts#setupUpdater]] registers update IPC handlers, persists the auto-upgrade preference under Electron `userData`, and applies that preference to `autoUpdater.autoDownload`.

When GitHub reports a newer release, [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] shows an upgrade button in the sidebar footer as soon as the app reaches the main layout. The button downloads the update when needed, shows download progress, and changes into a restart action after the update is ready.

[[src/renderer/src/components/settings/AboutPane.tsx#AboutPane]] (the About & Updates pane of the settings modal) presents the desktop app as its own card, separate from the Hermes Agent engine card — the two update on independent channels. The card shows the app version, the auto-upgrade toggle, and an explicit update action: [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/useSettingsData.ts#useSettingsData]] subscribes to the same `onUpdateAvailable`/`onUpdateDownloadProgress`/`onUpdateDownloaded`/`onUpdateError` events as the footer button and adds a manual `checkDesktopUpdate` (via `checkForUpdates`) plus a `handleDesktopUpdate` that downloads, then restarts via `installUpdate`. When auto-upgrade is enabled the startup release check downloads automatically; when disabled, downloading waits for the user's click (footer button or this card's action).

## Up-to-date check

An up-to-date app reports no update rather than offering its own version. electron-updater's `checkForUpdates()` resolves with the feed's info even when it is not newer than the running build, so [[src/main/app/updater.ts#offeredUpdateVersion]] returns a version only when `isUpdateAvailable` is true.

Before that fix the renderer treated the feed version as "update available", the download then threw electron-updater's "Please check update first", and the sidebar showed "Update failed". The download handler also runs a check first when none has found an update, and reports "No update is available" instead of the library's error.

## Stable and beta release channels

Two GitHub Actions workflows publish builds; only the stable channel reaches end users' auto-update, so a beta can be tested without risking their devices.

`release.yml` (stable) runs on a push to the `release` branch: it tags `v<version>` from `package.json`, builds all platforms, and publishes a normal GitHub Release carrying the `latest*.yml` update feed. `beta-release.yml` runs on a push to `beta` (or manual dispatch): it stamps a prerelease version `v<version>-beta.<run>` via `scripts/set-version.mjs`, builds the same signed/notarized artifacts, and publishes a **GitHub prerelease** carrying a `beta*.yml` feed.

Linux AppImage names include `${arch}` between version and extension, so x64 and arm64 outputs can coexist without overwriting one another. Stable and beta arm64 jobs also publish their architecture-specific updater feed (`latest-linux-arm64.yml` or `beta-linux-arm64.yml`) beside the installer. [[tests/release-artifacts.test.ts]] locks both invariants.

The isolation is structural: the updater ([[src/main/app/updater.ts#setupUpdater]]) leaves `allowPrerelease` off, so electron-updater's GitHub provider only ever resolves the latest **non-prerelease** release's `latest.yml`. A beta prerelease is therefore invisible to stable clients — testers download the beta installer manually from the prerelease. The beta workflow skips winget + the landing-page rebuild and uses a separate `beta-release` concurrency group so it never cancels a stable release. Cutting a beta for the _next_ version requires bumping `package.json` first (a beta of an already-released version sorts lower than its stable tag).

### Release security and quality gates

Pull requests and main-branch pushes must have no lint warnings and no high-severity production dependency advisories before release work can proceed.

The CI workflow installs the locked dependency tree, runs `npm run audit:prod`, type-checks, tests, and treats lint as blocking. The audit wrapper retries only transient registry/network failures; a reported high-severity vulnerability still fails immediately. The install step fetches the pinned Electron runtime once before tests, and the suite uses four workers so parallel imports never race a lazy binary download or starve short tests. [[tests/audit-production-dependencies.test.ts]] covers retry classification, while [[tests/release-artifacts.test.ts]] protects these controls, the audit threshold, and the zero-warning lint policy from accidental removal.

#### Transient audit outages

The production audit retries temporary npm registry and network failures without weakening vulnerability enforcement.

HTTP 5xx responses, DNS failures, resets, timeouts, and unreachable-registry errors receive up to three attempts with short backoff. Audit findings are not classified as transient and fail on the first attempt. `scripts/audit-production-dependencies.mjs` implements the classification boundary.

### macOS signing keychain

Stable and beta release jobs import the Developer ID certificate into a workflow-owned temporary keychain before packaging, making signing reliable across GitHub runner updates.

`scripts/import-macos-certificate.sh` creates a random keychain password, adds the keychain to the user search list, imports the `.p12` with `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, and grants `codesign` access with the distinct keychain password required by macOS 26.6. Electron Builder receives only `CSC_KEYCHAIN`, so it cannot recreate the password mix-up. Both architecture jobs run even if one fails, verify that a Developer ID Application identity exists before packaging, and delete the temporary keychain afterward. [[tests/macos-signing.test.ts]] exercises keychain discovery, password separation, and credential cleanup; [[tests/release-artifacts.test.ts]] prevents either release channel from bypassing the staging flow.

#### Identity output consumption

Signing verification consumes the complete identity list before deciding success, so early pipe closure cannot reject a valid Developer ID identity under `pipefail`.

`scripts/import-macos-certificate.sh` retains failure propagation from the identity command and requires a matching identity. [[tests/macos-signing.test.ts]] exercises short output and a list exceeding pipe capacity, alongside password separation and credential cleanup.

### Native module packaging

Stable and beta macOS builds verify the exact architecture-specific `better-sqlite3` prebuild that the packaged runtime loads.

Electron Builder explicitly unpacks `node_modules/better-sqlite3/prebuilds/*.node` from ASAR. After signing and notarization, `scripts/verify-native-module-architecture.sh` locates `darwin-x64.node` or `darwin-arm64.node` inside the packaged app and rejects a missing or mismatched binary. [[tests/release-artifacts.test.ts]] keeps the package rule and both release workflows aligned with the dependency's runtime layout.

### Platform package identity

Mithril Linux packages use `/opt/Mithril` and macOS uses the `Mithril.app` bundle and executable. RPM filenames retain the `.rpm` extension required by release uploads.

This fork's product name is space-free because Chromium's Linux launch path fails when it contains spaces; upstream used `/opt/HermesOne` and `Hermes One.app`.

The global packaging product name supplies Electron Builder's Linux install-directory component. The macOS `executableName`, platform display labels, and Linux sandbox hook now use Mithril. [[tests/packaging-identity.test.ts]] validates the configuration and checks the packaging gate. The old Kotoba app ID and bundle path are historical test fixtures, not a supported update path.

## Kotoba fork release channel

The Kotoba fork (`cloud-kotoba/org-hermesone-hermes-desktop`) does not use GitHub releases or GitHub Actions: its feed is electron-updater's `generic` provider at `https://app.kotoba.cloud/download/`, and builds are made on a mac-mini.

The old fork used `publish.provider: generic` at that URL so it could not update to upstream Hermes One. The Mithril repo reserves `https://app.mithril.fund/download/` for its future stable feed. Version `0.8.0-preview.1` publishes native Windows x64, Linux x64/ARM64, and Apple silicon/Intel Mac packages with checksums. The inherited stable and beta workflows remain disabled; a separate manual preview workflow builds the additional platforms on native runners and appends them to the existing prerelease after package inspection.

The old fork published content-addressed artifacts through `scripts/publish-release.cljk`, `kotoba.app.edn`, and `app-kotoba-cloud.desktop-releases`. Those old-account publisher files were removed from the Mithril repo. They remain in Git history as provenance; Mithril releases use GitHub release assets exposed through the app download route.

### Signed and notarized macOS builds

The macOS preview is signed with the Mithril Developer ID Application identity and notarized by Apple, so Gatekeeper can validate it without a manual security override.

Release jobs import the encrypted signing identity into an isolated temporary keychain and stage an App Store Connect API key for notarization. Missing credentials fail packaging instead of falling back to a development or ad-hoc release. The preview still uses manual updates and opens the verified App download page.

`build/afterPack.js` first repairs the packed bundle inside-out with an ad-hoc identity — every Mach-O leaf, framework, helper app, and the outer app. Electron Builder then replaces that preparatory signature with the configured Developer ID identity and submits the app for notarization. A missing leaf signature or failed framework sign blocks the build before publication.

## Preview update feed naming

Prerelease versions such as `0.8.0-preview.1` bake `channel: preview` into `app-update.yml`, so the generic provider requests `preview*.yml` and the preview workflow publishes those names.

electron-updater requests `preview.yml` (Windows), `preview-mac.yml`, `preview-linux.yml` and `preview-linux-arm64.yml`. [[tests/first-run-mithril.test.ts]] pins this; the inherited `latest*.yml` names belong to the disabled stable workflow.
