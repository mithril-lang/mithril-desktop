 * Detect whether `partial` looks like a chunk-dropped copy of `full`.

 * "! What are we working on?" for "Hey! What are we working on today?", or
 * "Sat planet from the Sun" for "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun".
 *
 * A plain character-subsequence test is too loose: unrelated English
 * sentences often embed as scattered 1–2 character fragments, which would
 * make a genuine pre-tool-call segment (or a distinct short reasoning
 * segment) look like a damaged copy and get erased. So the match is greedy
 * over runs: every matched segment must be at least `minRun` characters
 * (the last segment may be shorter — a trailing "?" survives chunking), with
 * arbitrary gaps between runs. On top of the shape test, callers get
 * coverage guards: the partial must be non-trivial (≥ `minLength`) and cover
 * a substantial share of the full text (≥ `minCoverage`), so a tiny
 * fragment can never cancel a long canonical text.
 *
 * Inputs are expected to be whitespace-normalized by the caller.
